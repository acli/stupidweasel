Hi Daniel,

Sorry for the late reply. Happy New Year!

The current list is at https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/public-art/

The older, retired version of the list (not maintained by 311) is at
https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/public-art-and-monuments/ . I believe
only the 2017 version has any records of the public art pieces at
subway stations.

Regards,

Ambrose
